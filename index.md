### CPSC 120

Lab-06

This lab is my favorite out of all of the labs completed throughout the semester because this was about the point where coding started to become easy for me and more enjoyable. Also we started learning about command line arguments and containers that week as well. I was able to put my knowledge from what I had learned and apply it to that week’s lab. The output from the lab was also fun in getting to put in a sandwich order and the computer completing it for you.

Lab-02

Although this lab was’t very difficult, I still enjoyed it for many reasons. It was my very first introduction into programming and I did fairly well on it considering it was my first time writing code. It was a very fun introduction as we were making a fill in the blank game. I was able to use std cin and cout to have the user input various nouns and verbs. At the end their input would go into the premade sentences and make them complete sentences.

Lab-04 part 2

This lab is one of my favorites because of the secret number game we were creating. Similar to other labs I was able to implement std cout and cin to create this as well as the addition of if statements. I was able to create a fun game for anyone to play and participate in with the code I created and I was very proud of the outcome of it.
